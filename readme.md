This project is a full stack store application which users can search, geolocate, review and curate their favourite restaurants from around the world.
the backend of the application is built with Nodejs, Express framework, mongoDB as the database using the Moongose librery and the front end is using the Pug template engine.

The application has three main models — Users, Stores and Reviews — all of which are relational. It is designed to hit upon many of today's application needs such as user authentication, database storage, Ajax REST API, file upload and image resizing.
